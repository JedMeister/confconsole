Confconsole - Networking
========================

.. contents::

Overview
--------

Networking allows the user to allocate a server IP address via DHCP
(default) or set a static IP.

**IMPORTANT:** setting a static IP address on a cloud instance (e.g. AWS
EC2) will break your server's internet access and may make it unreachable.
**unless you know exactly what you are doing; DO NOT ADJUST NETWORKING ON
CLOUD SERVERS!** You have been warned!

As of Confconsole v2.0.0 (default in v16.0+ TurnKey appliances), all cloud
builds have Confconsole's Networking options disabled (``networking false``
in ``/etc/confconsole/confconsole.conf``).

DHCP
----

Selecting **DHCP** from the menu will querry the local DHCP server for a new
dynamically allocated IP address.

Static
------

As noted above; **DO NOT change network settings on a cloud server!**

Selecting **StaticIP** from the menu allows you to set a static IP address
as follows:

- IP Adress: The desired static IP address
- Netmask: Subnet details (if you are on a LAN with 192.168.x.x then
  it's probably 255.255.255.0)
- Default Gateway: The internet Gateway IP address (your router IP if on
  a LAN)
- Name Server(s): The IP address(es) of DNS servers to use. Currently
  allows up to 3.

Notes
-----

By default, initially TurnKey Linux sets an IP address via DHCP (see
limitations below).

Changes to network config via Confconsole are persistent and will
survive reboot (see limitations below).

Limitations
-----------

Only IPv4 addresses are currently supported.

In most build types, by default TurnKey Linux sets an IP address via
DHCP. The exceptions to that are Proxmox/LXC and Docker. Generally these
builds have an IP (static or dynamic), set via the host when
initially created. 

In some limited cases (e.g. Proxmox - depending on configuration),
any networking adjustments made via Confconsole (or other means) will apply,
but will NOT be persistent post-reboot. The networking can still be
reconfigured on the running system. However, changes will be lost on
reboot. As a general rule, it is recommended that unless you have a need
to reconfigure networking within the instance, set the desired configuration
on the host.

Some other platforms (e.g. AWS EC2 and OpenStack) will almost certainly
break if a static IP is set! As of Confconsole v2.0.0 (default in TurnKey
v16.0+) TurnKey Cloud builds (currently includes EC2, Xen and OpenStack)
have the Networking config options disabled.

Technical note
--------------

Technically the Networking option is not provided by a plugin as it
is a legacy "Advanced" menu option.
